Suppose you need to process 1 billion trades per day. 
How would you design a system to: 
    Keep track of the top 10 trades by volume 
    Guarantee low memory usage and constant-time updates

Input example : 
{
    trade_id     : unique identifier
    timestamp    : time trade executed
    symbol       : stock/asset symbol (e.g., AAPL)
    volume       : number of shares/contracts traded
    price        : trade price
    side         : buy/sell
}

IDEA: store (volume, id) tuple in minHeap
      store only 10 largest trades
"""

        else:
            # only if incoming is bigger

Given a stream of integers, design a data structure to:
Insert numbers
Return the median at any time
(Discuss trade-offs, not just code)

Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]

IDEA: 
We can use Balanced BST with O(logn) time insertion. But more complex to implement. 
Optimal: We can use min-max Heaps and return the top of the heap

In C, what happens if two threads write to the same memory location without synchronization?
Ans: data race condition where behavior is undefined. Final value is not defined and we need explicit synchronization to fix.
